    <h1 style="text-align: center; margin-block: 2rem; font-family: sans-serif;">About Us</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-inline: 5rem; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 1.75;">For the past 30 years, Christian Friends International (CFI) has been a steadfast supporter of education, providing scholarships to deserving and financially constrained students who aspire to excel in technical and nursing fields. CFI's generous contributions have enabled countless individuals to pursue their dreams, empowering them to secure a better future and contribute meaningfully to society.

      CFI's impact extends far beyond education. Its alumni, equipped with high-quality training and professional skills, are now working across the globe, making significant contributions to their respective fields. From healthcare to engineering and other technical sectors, these professionals carry forward CFI's vision of transforming lives through education and opportunity.
      
      To further support fresh graduates in transitioning from academia to professional life, CFI has recently partnered with CTTC to establish an Internship and Job Cell. This initiative is designed to provide career counseling, internships, and job placement opportunities for graduates in technical and nursing disciplines. By bridging the gap between education and employment, CFI ensures that its students are not only well-prepared for their careers but also have access to practical work experiences and career-launching opportunities.
      
      Through these comprehensive efforts—scholarships, global alumni achievements, and career development support—CFI continues to empower individuals and strengthen communities. Its unwavering commitment over the past three decades reflects a legacy of hope, opportunity, and transformation that inspires countless lives around the world.</p>
